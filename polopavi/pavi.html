    planning to try out all the things that i have learnt so far in this particular html file. let's see how that works out...

      Now for people who have similar interest in food but are unable to have it just because they're afraid that they will gain weight and also are desperate enough to loose
    weight, you can actually follow my sister's page on instagram, she has some really amazing stuff there.. just go and check it out! If interested just
    <a href="http:/www.instagram.com/theketohack_">clickhere</a>.She has also shared the recipe with it and it's honestly very easy to make.

   <h2>My Childhood </h2>
    <p> I was born and brought up in India. i come from a very small city-Ahmedabad. I'm currently staying in bangalore and pursuing 
        Btech in BMSIT. I took up this html course in coursera and I'm honestly having a lot of fun now that I finally found my way around html!While doing my final project given
        to me by coursera, i thought i can also promote my sister's page while doing so..   
    </p>
   <p> Finally thanks for your valuable time! </p>
